### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Team members: Chenzhong Zhong, Ruoxi Bai, Xin Jin,Yujia Wang, Yan Wang

Summary: Tasked with increasing picture resolution in this project, we trained a GBM model as the baseline , and an Xgboost with modified data and parameters as the improvement, successfully increasing the PSNR.

[Contribution Statement] Chenzhong Zhong did feature extraction, training, super resolution, and PSNR part of both models.
                         Ruoxi Bai developed the Xgboost model as an improvement, including tuning parameters with cross validation.
                         Xin Jin did super resolution for both models, and tuning parameters with cross validation for the baseline model.
                         Yujia Wang did super resolution part for both models, and cross validation for the Xgboost model.
                         Yan Wang partipated in group meetings.
